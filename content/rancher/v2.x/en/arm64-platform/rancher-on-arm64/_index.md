Rancher currently supports running on the ARM64 platform.  

The latest Rancher's image `rancher/rancher` is published using the [docker manifest](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/manifest/), so whether on the AMD64 platform or the ARM64 platform, you can use the same image name and tag to install Rancher.  

About how to install Rancher, please refer to the [Installation]({{< baseurl >}}/rancher/v2.x/en/installation/) section.
